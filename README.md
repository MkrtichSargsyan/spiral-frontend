# Spiral frontend

In this application, I have an appointment app for a Spiral's office. The user can choose from a list of houses and choose an appointment with the agent who is selling that house. The user logs in and signs up to the application using Json Web Token.

To build this application I used:

 - Javascript ES6;
 - Html/CSS;
 - Tailwind.CSS
 - React.js, React Hooks, React Router;
 - Redux, Redux-thunk;
 - Jest;
 - Linters ( eslint and stylelint)
 - Netlify

To build this application we used:

 - Rspec to test the project;
 - Linters ( Rubocop )

In this application I test the components using the snapshots and I test the logical functions using jest.
